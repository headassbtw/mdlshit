These will assume you're on linux, if you aren't, I genuinely don't know what to tell you lmao

1. Run `cmake -S ./ -B ./build`
2. Run `cmake --build ./build`
3. Profit

### Windows:

1. You must have MinGW gcc installed, idk what libs it needs, just shove the entire AUR onto your ssd
2. Idk i don't feel like explaining kek
