# Model converter go brr

## Compiling:

* `git clone https://github.com/headassbtw/mdlshit --recurse-submodules`
* Download GLEW from somewhere, extraxt the source code to the folder (for some ass-backwards reason, GLEW doesn't do that.)
* It's cmake, figure it out

Zero support or consideration will be given in regards to using MSVC, find a better compiler.
